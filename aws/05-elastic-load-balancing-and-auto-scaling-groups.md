## Scalability
- Application/System handle greater loads
- Vertical Scaling
  - Increase the size of the instance
  - Non distributed systems such as database
  - Hardware Limit
  - Example : t2.micro to t2.large
- Horizontal Scaling
  - Increase number of instances/systems
  - Distributed systems
  - Web applications

## High Availability
- Horizontal Scaling
- Running application in atleast 2 Availability Zones
- Goal is to survive datacenter loss (disaster)
